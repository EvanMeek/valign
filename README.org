#+TITLE: Valign.el

This package provides visual alignment for Org and Markdown tables on GUI Emacs. It can properly align tables containing variable-pitch font, CJK characters and images. In the meantime, the text-based alignment generated by Org mode (or Markdown mode) is left untouched.

To use this package, load it and run =M-x valign-mode RET=. And any Org tables in Org mode should be automatically aligned. If you want to align a table manually, run =M-x valign-table RET= on a table.

Features not yet supported:
 - org-ident. It uses line-prefix, and we don’t support it right now.
 - Hided links in markdown still occupy the full length of the link, because it uses character composition, which we don’t support now.

If you are interested in adding support for them, look into ~valign--pixel-width-from-to~.

You can use style below by customizing ~valign-separator-row-style~.
